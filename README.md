## Project Overview
In the ever-competitive world of hospitality, staying ahead of the curve requires more than just great serviceâ€”it demands data-backed strategies. AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain with 20+ years of legacy, found itself facing a tough situation. Competitors were gaining ground, and ineffective decision-making was eating into their market share and revenue.

As a data analyst, I was tasked with helping AtliQ Grands understand their business from a new perspectiveâ€”through their data!
### Tools Used:
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel
### Power BI Integration:
I leveraged Power BI as the primary tool for visualizing and analyzing data in this project. Power BI enabled me to create an intuitive and interactive dashboard, integrating multiple data sources seamlessly. With its robust features, I implemented advanced DAX measures, built calculated columns, and utilized a variety of visuals, including line charts, donut charts, and KPI cards. The toolâ€™s flexibility allowed for the easy creation of filters, slicers, and tooltips, enhancing the user experience and making insights accessible and actionable for decision-makers.
### Key terms & business concepts:
- Realization%: Percentage of successful â€˜checked outâ€™ bookings.
- RevPAR: Revenue per Available Room.
- DSRN: Daily Sellable Room Nights.
- DURN: Daily Utilized Room Nights.
- DBRN: Daily Booked Room Nights.
- ADR: Average Daily Rate.
- Pareto Principle: The 80/20 rule, where 80% of results come from 20% of efforts.
### Important insights derived:
- Mumbai leads in generating the highest revenue.
- Delhi brings in the lowest revenue, despite having the highest occupancy and rating.
- AtliQ Seasons shows the lowest occupancy rate and an average rating of around 2/5, indicating a need for improvement in service quality or a focus on boosting hotel ratings.
### My Contributions: 
- Inserted Gauge visual for illustrating average rating of hotels across major cities.
- Added a tooltip for enhanced hotel category insights
- Incorporated a stacked bar chart for showing the occupancy by day type (weekend/weekday).
- Created additional new measures to maintain a dynamic funnel chart effectively managing filter context to ensure it remains unaffected by city slicer selections.
### Key Takeaways:
- In the hospitality industry, the right data insights can unlock doors to new growth.
- A great dashboard isnâ€™t just about numbersâ€”itâ€™s about clarity, actionability, and foresight.
-	Never underestimate the power of going beyond the briefâ€”thereâ€™s always more value to uncover!
